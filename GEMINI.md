# Project: Credit Hour Calculator

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the source code for the "Credit Hour Calculator," a single-page web application designed for educators. The application provides an interactive form to calculate student workload based on a predefined list of academic activities.

The project is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no backend dependencies.

## Key Files

*   `prd.md`: The Product Requirements Document, which outlines the project's vision, features, and technical specifications. It serves as the single source of truth for the application's functionality.
*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the application.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the application's logic, including the dynamic generation of the form and the calculation of credit hours.

## Building and Running

This is a static web project. To run the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. No build process is required.

## Development Conventions

*   **Data Source**: The application's core data is derived from **Appendix A** in the `prd.md` file. All activities, categories, and time calculations must be implemented as specified in this document.
*   **Technology Stack**: The project is intentionally limited to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries or frameworks are to be used.
*   **User Interface**: The UI should be clean, intuitive, and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Reporting**: The application must include a feature to generate a clean, printable PDF report of the calculated credit hours.
