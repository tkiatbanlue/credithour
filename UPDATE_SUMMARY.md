# Credit Hour Calculator - Update Summary v1.6

## Summary of Changes

This update focuses on making Thai the default language and ensuring English PDFs use the same font as Thai.

## Key Updates

1. Language Improvements:
   - Made Thai the default language for the application
   - Updated initial UI text to Thai
   - Changed initial language toggle button text

2. PDF Generation Improvements:
   - Ensured English PDFs use the same Sarabun font as Thai PDFs
   - Consistent font usage across all PDF outputs

3. Version Tracking:
   - Updated version to v1.6 across all files
   - Updated PRD version to 1.6 (Feature Enhancement)

## Implementation Notes

The application now defaults to Thai language when first loaded. Users can still switch to English using the language toggle button. PDF generation now consistently uses the Sarabun font for both languages, ensuring consistent appearance and proper character rendering.
